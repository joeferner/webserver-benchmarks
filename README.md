# Webserver Banchmarks

## Multi-Language Performance Comparison

A benchmarking suite that compares the performance of web servers implemented in multiple programming languages and frameworks.

## Features

* Benchmarks HTTP servers written in **Rust, Node.js, Python**
* Unified **test harness** for consistent load generation and result collection
* **Dockerized environment** for reproducible runs on any system
* Automated result aggregation and **interactive visualizations** (via JSON/HTML reports)
* Benchmarking scenarios: static file serving, JSON responses, CPU tasks, IO tasks

## Goals

* Identify performance characteristics across languages and frameworks
* Help developers make **data-driven choices** for high-performance web applications
* Promote fair, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking practices
